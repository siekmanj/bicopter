# bicopter
A flight controller for a Bicopter multirotor. A Bicopter uses two counter-rotating propellors and two servos to control pitch, yaw and thrust. I thought it would be an interesting challenge to try to build one and write the flight controller from scratch for it.

You can see a video of the [build process here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6mFsGETFIA).
